import mdtraj as md

"""
This code uses the mdtraj library to simulate the motion of a system over time.
It first loads the topology and coordinates for the system from a PDB file and
a DCD file, respectively. The topology is used to describe the connectivity and
types of atoms in the system, while the coordinates represent the initial positions
of these atoms.

The code then sets up the simulation parameters such as temperature, friction,
and timestep. A Langevin integrator is used to simulate the system dynamics. This
is a type of numerical integration technique that combines the Newtonian dynamics
of the system with a random force, known as a "thermostat", to mimic the effects of
a heat bath on the system.

The simulation is run for 1000 steps and the final coordinates of the atoms are
saved to a new DCD file named "final.dcd". The final coordinates represents the
position of atoms after the simulation has ended.
