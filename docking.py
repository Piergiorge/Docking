"""
This code is using the Pybel library, which is a
Python wrapper for the Open Babel toolkit, to
perform a molecular docking simulation. The script
loads a ligand and a receptor molecules from the files
ligand.mol2 and receptor.pdb respectively. Then it sets
up the input for the docking simulation by creating a Pybel
Docking object, where the ligand and receptor molecules are
set as the ligand and receptor properties. After that, the
script runs the docking simulation by calling the run() method 
of the Docking object and finally, prints the energy of the
final complex using the energy attribute of the result object.
